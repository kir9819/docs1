# Existend Docs2

## How to push documents:

- Documents must be in two languages (2 files in repo)
- Name of documents must start with "[ru]" or "[en]" (depends on language)
- Text after square brackets should be the same regardless of language
- **AND** first string in each documents is its name. It's different for each file, you don't need to write any symbols except name, for example:
```
Instruction for creating a server app on Nodejs, Express and MongoDB
```
- Second string in each documents is tags, for example
```
Tags: nodejs, express, mongodb
```
